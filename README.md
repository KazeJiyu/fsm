# Executable Finite State Machine

## Motivation

This project is aimed to experiment with [GEMOC Studio](http://gemoc.org/studio.html).

More specifically, the goal is to create a graphical editor based on [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/) that makes able to edit a Finite State Machine (FSM). Futhermore, it must be possible to simulate a FSM's execution thanks to GEMOC's Model Animator.

## Implemented features

- [x] ECore meta-model
- [x] Step-by-step CLI execution
- [x] Diagram viewpoint
- [x] Diagram editor
- [x] Tailored Properties view
- [x] Step-by-step UI execution

## Implementation

The [Wiki](https://github.com/KazeJiyu/gemoc-fsm/wiki) sums up the implementation of such a FSM and describes how to use GEMOC. This is _not_ a tutorial, rather a capitalization of my experience on using GEMOC Studio.
